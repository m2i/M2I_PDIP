# Make to Innovate Project Development and Implementation Plan (PDIP)
The Make to Innovate Project Development and Implementation Plan (PDIP) is a document designed to help students develop the tools needed to successfully plan the semester for their project. While the PDIP is given to the Program Manager, everyone must read and sign off on this document before it is accepted. This document now replaces your charter. As we have done in the past, we will use this document to determine your deliverable assignments in Canvas and allocate resources such as funding, equipment, and people. 

The PDIP can be modified throughout the semester, but each submission will require a formal review. A change will also require a Design Decision document that will outline why the change is needed, what options were considered, and how the group came to the decision they made. Once reviewed, the official deliverable in Canvas will be updated. The final cut-off for any changes will be Week 10 of the semester. After that, no changes can be made.
